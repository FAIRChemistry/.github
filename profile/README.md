# Welcome to the FAIR Chemistry GitHub!

This organization is home to various useful tools, libraries, and data models aimed at providing means for FAIR and sustainable research in chemistry and beyond.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start Guide

Unsure where to begin?  
Have a look at our [pyAnIML](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/pyAnIML) library for working with the powerful Analytical Information Markup Language (AnIML) standard! Working with thermodynamic rather than analytical data? Visit our [pyThermoML](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/pyThermoML) library instead. Or maybe you are interested in FAIR tools and workflows for small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments? You can find these in our [SAS_toolbox](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/SAS_toolbox) repository.  

Nothing of interest for you so far?  
There is much more to be found, so please take a look around. Still not satisfied? Consider contributing to the ever expanding FAIR Chemistry GitHub!
